I am a post-doctoral researcher in the [Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) group in the department of Computer Science at Aalto University, Helsinki in Finland.
I am currently exploring the topic of privacy preserving Bayesian inference under the constraint of [differential privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy).


Before moving to Finland, I worked on my Ph.D thesis at the University of Warwick, UK with [Prof. Graham Cormode](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/~graham/). Previously, I did my masters with [Prof. John Augustine](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~augustine/index.html) at wonderful [IIT Madras](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/) in India. 

I am no longer maintaining my [Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/u1554597) page.

**Note: I am currently on industry job market (research/data scientist, machine learning engineer).** 


As evident from my CV, my research topic is privacy preserving machine learning. I have 3 years
of industry experience as a software engineer and a data scientist. I have competent programming
skills in **Python (PyTorch, Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas, Pystan etc.)** and enough mathematical maturity to pick
up most machine learning topics.
<p>
I have worked on diverse topics including theory of distributed computing, privacy preserving
technologies, statistical queries, and Bayesian inference. My research work has been published in top
machine learning and privacy conferences including ICML/AISTATS/KDD. 

My research background provides me the emotional tenacity required to navigate in the uncertain/unexplored waters.

I am in the process of updating my [GitHub](https://github.com/Tejasvk). If would like to see some code samples, please feel free
to ask.
