I am a post-doctoral researcher in the [Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) group in the department of Computer Science at Aalto University, Helsinki in Finland.
I am currently exploring the topic of privacy preserving Bayesian inference under the constraint of [differential privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy).


Before moving to Finland, I worked on my Ph.D thesis at the University of Warwick, UK with [Prof. Graham Cormode](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/~graham/). Previously, I did my masters with [Prof. John Augustine](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~augustine/index.html) at wonderful [IIT Madras](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/) in India. 

I am no longer maintaining my [Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/u1554597) page. It will be removed eventually by the University. 

**Note: I am currently on industry job market (research/data scientist, machine learning engineer). Please get in touch if you happen to have an interesting
opportunity.** 


My research topic is privacy preserving machine learning. I have 3 years
of industry experience as a software engineer and a data scientist. I have competent programming
skills in **Python (PyTorch, Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas, Pystan etc.)** and enough mathematical maturity to pick
up most machine learning topics.

I have worked on diverse topics including theory of distributed computing, privacy preserving
technologies, statistical queries, and Bayesian inference. My research work has been published in top
machine learning (ICML/AISTATS/KDD), data mining/database (SIGMOD/VLDB/ICDE/TKDE), and distributed computing (IPDPS) venues. 

My research background provides me the emotional tenacity required to navigate in the uncertain/unexplored waters.
