I am a post-doctoral researcher in the [Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) group in the department of Computer Science at Aalto University, Helsinki in Finland.
I am currently exploring the topic of privacy preserving Bayesian inference under the constraint of [differential privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy).


Before moving to Finland, I worked for my Ph.D thesis at the University of Warwick, UK mentored by [Prof. Graham Cormode](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/~graham/). Previously, I did my masters with [Prof. John Augustine](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~augustine/index.html) at wonderful [IIT Madras](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/) in India.
